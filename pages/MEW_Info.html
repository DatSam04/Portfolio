                    <p><strong>Responsible:</strong> <br>
                        • Implement tables and rules<br>
                        • Define the logic for computer, including ship placement, tracking hits and misses, as well as
                        generating random moves<br>
                        • Offer options to check the game outcome and provide information about the computer fleet<br>
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Learning:</strong> <br>
                        • Demonstrate <strong class="skill">Algorithm Design</strong> for randomly placing ships without overlapping and adhere to game
                        rule and manipulating a game grid efficiently<br>
                        • Use <strong class="skill">Data Structures</strong> for a dynamic list of item<br>
                        • <strong class="skill">Error Handling</strong> to prevent invalid ship placement and overlapping positions in computer movement<br>
                        • <strong class="skill">Object-Oriented Programming</strong><br>
